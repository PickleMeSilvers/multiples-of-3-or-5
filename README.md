# CodeWars multiples of 3 and 5

This is the description that CodeWars gave:
"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once."

I struggled with this one initially knowing that I needed to loop from zero to the value passed in.  I then realised that all I needed to do was to find the modulo result from the loop counter, against 3 and 5.

I'm very impressed with some of the Linq solutions which I hope to take forward.  Excellent guys and girls!
